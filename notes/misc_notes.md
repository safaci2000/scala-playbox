# Misc Notes

val == read only
var == mutable

## multiline

var foobar =
  |   "this is a test"

## Arrays

Size of array can't be changed but the value is.  Hence arrays is a mutable construct.


newList = 5 :: oldList // returns a new list created by prepending the new element.

aList ::: bList // returns a concatenation of 2 lists.
